# Bikesharing

## Overview
The Tableau Story can be seen using this link: [Citibike Story](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/rylee.jensen/viz/CitibikeStory_16415800647770/CitibikeStory?publish=yes)

The framework for this project was to help analyze and visualize bike-sharing data from the company CitiBike in New York City into a presentation to to encourage investors to begin a similar bike-share program in Des Moines, Iowa. Although these are two completely different cities, we can use the data from NYC to answer a few questions we might have about starting up a program in Des Moines:
  - Using the month of August, what are the most popular times & day to ride a bike?
  - Who uses bike-share programs?
  - What areas of the city are most popular for bike riding?
  - How much are the bikes used and how much maintenance is required?
 
## Results
We can a first glance at the peak hours for riding a bike in the month of August. In the graph below, we can see that the most popular times to ride a bike sit between 5:00 pm and 6:00 pm. While the low hours sit between 12:00 am and 5:00 am. These early hours would be a good time to do bike repair and maintenance.

The map below shows us where the most popular starting locations are to ride a bike. We can use this data from NYC and apply it to Des Moines by looking closer at the popular areas. Is it an area near downtown with a lot of shops? Is it next to bike trails? This information is important to know so investors will know how many bikes to put where.

This graph shows us that the average trip duration on CitiBikes are under an hour in length. Most people are riding bikes for a max of 15 minutes and rarely ride bikes for over an hour.

This graph, similar as above, breaks down the number of rides by duration and separates the data by gender. We can see that most rides are from male-identifying customers.

This heat maps helps us see the number of bike trips taken by weekday for each hour of the day. The darker red color indicates more bike trips, while the lighter yellow color indicates a smaller number of bike trips. Thursday between 5:00 pm and 6:00 pm have a particularly high number of bike rides.

This heat maps shows the same information as above, but the data is separated by gender.

This graph shows the number of bike trips broken down by gender for each day of the week. A male subscriber is much more likely to ride bikes than a male customer. Again, this data shows us that the most popular day to ride a bike during the month of August is Thursday.

## Summary
Looking at all the data we have analyzed above, bike-sharing services are quite popular in busy metropolitan areas as this attracts many tourists, the parking may be limited, and it makes more economical and environmental sense to get to where you're going on a bike. Most of the users are made up by male subscribers and while the weather is still pleasant in August, the most popular time to use the bike-sharing service is later in the evening. While we have a lot of good information here, there is definitely more that can be explored:
  - What happens to the bike-sharing services in the winter? Will people still use the bikes if there is snow on the ground? How will that affect the investors?
  - What is the life-span of a bike? How many times can you repair and maintain a bike until it needs to be replaced entirely? How much does it cost to replace a bike?

The bike-sharing service overall seems to be like a very good investment and I think it would do very well in a place like Des Moines, Iowa being that it is the capital and has quite a heavy population.
